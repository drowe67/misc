\title{Analog Transmission of Vocoder Features}
\maketitle

Given a vector of vocoder features $\bf{f}$, use an autoencoder $E$ to map them to a dimension $d$ latent vector $\bf{z}$ where $d$ is even.  The magnitude of each element $z_i$ of $\bf{z}$ is constrained to a maximum of 1, but unlike digital modulation is continuously valued and not constrained to a discrete set of points. For bandwidth efficient transmission over the channel the elements of $\bf{z}$ are mapped to $d/2$ complex symbols $\bf{q}$. Compared to classical digital modulation, the elements of $\bf{z}$ can be considered BPSK symbols (continuously valued, analog bits), and the elements of $\bf{q}$ analog QPSK symbols.

Our goal is to determine if reasonable speech quality can be obtained over a channel of bandwidth $B<3000$ Hz and SNR between 0 and 6dB, roughly the lower limit of Single Side Band (SSB) - a common power and bandwidth efficient form of analog radio communication.

\section{Noise Simulation}

The autoencoder output $\bf{z}$ is updated every $T_z=1/R_z$ seconds, giving a BPSK symbol rate of:
\begin{equation}
R_b=d/T_z
\end{equation}
For example with $T_z=0.04, d=80, R_b=2000$ symbols/s.  The QPSK symbol rate is given by:
\begin{equation}
R_q = \frac{d}{2T_z} 
\end{equation}
For example with $T_z=0.04, d=80, R_q=1000$ symbols/s.

We wish to simulate a channel with a user-defined $E_b/N_0$, where $E_b$ is the energy of each BPSK symbol, and $N_0$ is the noise power per unit bandwidth.  The energy of each BPSK symbol $E_b$ is the signal power $S$ divided by the symbol rate $R_b=1/T_b$.  The noise per unit bandwidth is the total noise power $N$ divided by the bandwidth $B$ of the system.  If we are simulating at one sample per symbol, $B=R_b$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{E_b}{N_0} &= \frac{S/R_b}{N/R_b} \\
                &= \frac{S}{N} \\
                &= \frac{A^2}{\sigma^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the amplitude of each BPSK symbol and $\sigma^2=N$ is the noise variance (mean noise energy per sample).  If the noise is zero mean, we can estimate $\sigma^2$ over $K$ noise samples $r_i$ as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}r_i^2
\end{equation}
We generate noise samples $r_i$ by sampling a unit variance, zero mean Gaussian noise source $\mathcal{N}_i(0,1)$ that is scaled by $\sigma$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:noise_sigma}
\begin{split}
r_i &= \sigma \mathcal{N}_i(0,1) \\
\sigma &= \frac{A}{\sqrt{Eb/N_0}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In practice we simulate the channel by adding noise to the QPSK symbols.  Due to orthogonality, this can be simulated as two independent channels that have the same noise power:
\begin{equation}
r_i = \sigma \mathcal{N}_{2i}(0,1) + j\sigma\mathcal{N}_{2i+1}(0,1)
\end{equation}

\section{SNR Measurement}

In order to compare with other methods of speech communication, it is useful to formulate expressions for estimating SNR from the BPSK and QPSK symbols.  The Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:snr_theory}
\begin{split}
\frac{S}{N} &= \frac{E_bR_b}{N_0B} \\
            &= \frac{E_qR_q}{N_0B}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
A noise bandwidth $B$ needs to be selected; common choices for HF radio are $B=3000$ Hz to compare with existing analog and digital voice modes, and $B=1$ to obtain a normalised $C/N_0$ carrier power to noise density ratio.
 
At one sample per symbol, the power, the mean energy of each QPSK symbol over a window of $K$ samples is given by:
\begin{equation}
E_q = Var(q_i) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}|q_i|^2
\end{equation}
As each QPSK symbol contains 2 BPSK symbols, the energy is split evenly:
\begin{equation}
E_b = E_q/2
\end{equation}
For example if the symbol amplitude is $A=1, E_b=A^2=1$, then $E_q=1+1=2$.

For transmission over multipath channels we arrange the QPSK symbols as $N_c$ parallel carriers, each running at a symbol rate of $R_s=R_q/N_c$ symbols/s, where $R_s$ is chosen based on delay spread considerations.  Typical values for HF modems are $N_c=20$ and $R_s=50$ Hz. However the OFDM carriers are arranged such that the total symbol rate over the channel remains constant.  So for a given signal power $E_q$ and $E_b$ remain constant (Table \ref{tab:constant_eb}).

In order to evaluate the ML system early in the development process it is important to ensure the noise is correctly calibrated. The expressions above can be used to check the noise injection process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set a target $E_b/N_0$ for the simulation run, and calculate $\sigma$ using (\ref{eq:noise_sigma}).
\item Establish the equivalent target SNR from (\ref{eq:snr_theory}) evaluated using the target $E_b/N_0$.
\item After the simulation run measure $E_q=Var(q_i)$ over a sample of transmitted symbols.
\item Calculate measured SNR using (\ref{eq:snr_theory}) and compare. 
\end{enumerate}
