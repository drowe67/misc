The power received by pointing an antenna at the sun $P_{sun}$, and a quiet area of sky $P_{quiet}$ is used commonly used to estimate receiver $G/T$ \cite{flagg2006_det_gt}.  The power delivered to the receiver for each measurement is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P_{sun} &= (T_{sun}+T)G \\
P_{quiet} &= TG 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the antenna gain and $T$ is the system noise temperature; the sum of all noise temperature sources such as feedline losses, LNA, ground spillover, and sky noise. The $Y$ factor is the ratio of the two  measurements:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Y &= \frac{P_{sun}}{P_{quiet}} \\
  &= \frac{(T_{sun}+T)G}{TG} \\
  &= \frac{T_{sun}+T}{T} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Solving for $T$ we have:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:T}
T = \frac{T_{sun}}{Y-1}
\end{equation}

Expanding (\ref{eq:T})
