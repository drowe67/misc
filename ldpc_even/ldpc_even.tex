In LDPC decoders, the expression:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prob_even}
P_{even}^{m}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\prod_{i=1}^{m}(1-2p_{i})
\end{equation}
is used to determine the probability that an even number of bits are $1$, given $m$ bits, and the probability of bit $i$ being $1$ is $p_i$.  A proof is provided in \cite{gallager1963low}, however the introductory paper \cite{ryan2004introduction} suggests using induction which is the approach taken here.
