[ ] goal
    + control energy distribution across pitch cycle
    + thru selection of phases (and possibily amplitudes)
    + lets just start with phases
    + this means {theta_m} = f(alpha)
[ ] expression for min and max of a complex harmonic series
    + get my head around problem with tractable, toy example
    [ ] Find expression for Am and theta_m for 2nd order system, as
        a function of alpha
	[ ] DFT of 2nd order exp
	[ ] via z-transform
    [ ] octave demo
        + set alpha and omega_f, synth x_a(n) --- (1)
	+ get H(exp(jomega)) and hence Am, theta_m
	+ from freq domain synth x_a(n) -- (2)
	+ compare (1) and (2)
	+ measure alpha from (1) and (2)
	+ compare to actual alpha
    [ ] is general problem tractable anlaytically?  If No -> use ML        
        + fourier anlaysis says any perdiodic function can be expressed as
          sum of sinusoids
	+ but we don't know how to fit our spectra to a model.  At least
	  I don't
	+ could solve numerically perhaps (without NN), have starting
	  point for that from a few months ago, iterative version
[ ] take a real speech frame, Am and theta_m, synth
    + look at |x_a(n)| over a period or two
[ ] expression for alpha, given we have amplitudes
    + brute force it, find |x_a(0)| and |x_a(P)|
    + might actually need min & max of |x_a(n)|, not all sequences have max
      at start,and with linear offset, who knows
    + find min and max, est alpha
    + alpha is the input to the cost function.  Could also be envelope shape,
      but not sure that matters.  Trick is to avoid reduction
    + NN twiddles phases to min alpha across cycle.  Problem, how do we
      represent phases?  Perhaps part of sparse, cont function? Or mag
      spectra via HT, or IDFT?
[ ] reconcile impulse driving system over one cycle with harmonics
    driving system over many.  Derive FD or TD expression using both
[ ] test with simple contrived 2nd order system
    [ ] move to speech later
    [ ] visualise spiral on complex plane
[ ] show we can control energy distribution of a contrived signal
[ ] expression for how ear detects?    
    + need energy spread over time

ML model A
----------

+ for a single cycle, minimum is simply |x(P)|
+ not sure if max is |x(0)|
+ consider including some sort of energy match in cost function
+ feature input low rsln mag spectra, pitch, output high rsln mag spectra
+ compare with orig speech alpha (say via sinusoidial model, or HT or input
  speech)
+ cost function takes that and computes alpha.  Hmm, that's the messy part, we would
  need HT, sine syth in GPU
+ work in pre-emph domain
+ a latent space where we can mess with alpha would be nice
+ a win is squeezing of male formant bandwidths and greater phase shift
  thru fomants
+ So innovation here is cost function, we compare alphas rather than
  mag spectrum directly
+ test with some contrived spectra.  We could take 2nd or even 10th order
  spectra, make it lower resln, see if haronics are recovered.

ML Model B
----------

+ we know K=80 (un quantised) sounds good
+ as orginal spectrum (when passing thru HT) has narrow bandwidths, so good env properties
+ so use K=80 as a target, on basis that if we match that, envelope will be good
+ use some sort of weighted linear measure, to emphasise high energy formants
+ operate in pre-emp domain, so high formants get considered 
+ input feature B log K=20 smoothed, pitch, output Y_hat K=20
+ target Y K=80, loss weighted lin between Y and Y_hat
+ use log spectra inside NN to reduce DR, but loss operates on weighted linear
+ overcomes variable pitch thing.  Emphasises high enegry formants, but some consdieration
  of low energy parts of spectra
+ we can choose to just use phases, or use "filtered" amplitudes too
+ could include energy normalisation term in loss function
+ could compare alpha at end of each epoch, using code running on CPU (even shelled out to Octave)

Theory:
- if energy/power/amplitude drops to a minima over pitch cycle ear perceives
  a time domain modulation of click
