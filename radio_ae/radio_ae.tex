\title{Analog Transmission of Vocoder Features over Radio Channels}
\maketitle

Given a vector of vocoder features $\bf{f}$, use an autoencoder $E$ to map them to a dimension $d$ latent vector $\bf{z}$ where $d$ is even.  Unlike digital modulation, each element $z_i$ of $\bf{z}$ is continuously valued and not constrained to a discrete set of points.  For bandwidth efficient transmission over the channel the elements of $\bf{z}$ are mapped to $d/2$ complex symbols $\bf{q}$. Compared to classical digital modulation, the elements of $\bf{z}$ can be considered BPSK symbols (continuously valued, analog bits), and the elements of $\bf{q}$ analog QPSK symbols.

Our goal is to determine if reasonable speech quality can be obtained over a channel of bandwidth $B<3000$ Hz and SNR (measured in $B=3000$ Hz) of between 0 and 6dB, roughly the lower limit of Single Side Band (SSB) - a common power and bandwidth efficient form of analog radio communication.

\section{Simulation of AWGN Channels}

The autoencoder output $\bf{z}$ is updated every $T_z=1/R_z$ seconds, giving a BPSK symbol rate of:
\begin{equation}
R_b=d/T_z
\end{equation}
For example with $T_z=0.04, d=80, R_b=2000$ symbols/s.  The QPSK symbol rate is given by:
\begin{equation}
R_q = \frac{d}{2T_z} 
\end{equation}
For example with $T_z=0.04, d=80, R_q=1000$ symbols/s.

We wish to simulate an AWGN channel with a user-defined $E_b/N_0$, where $E_b$ is the energy of each BPSK symbol, and $N_0$ is the noise power per unit bandwidth.  Consider a real valued signal sampled off air (Figure \ref{fig:bandpass}).  We will follow convention and define signal and noise power in the ``single sided" bandpass interval of the frequency spectrum with bandwidth B centered on $\omega$.  As the interval is single sided, we must use complex valued quantities to represent it.

We wish to simulate a bandpass AWGN channel at baseband ($\omega=0$).  This implies a frequency shift of the complex valued signal, but the signal remains complex valued and it's power is unchanged. The negative frequency component on the LHS of Figure \ref{fig:bandpass} is redundant and after frequency shifting can be removed by filtering.

Note that even at baseband we must use complex valued quantities for the signal and noise to represent a bandpass signal of bandwidth $B$.  For example, given a fixed sample rate $B$ and noise power $N$, a real valued noise sequence can only represent a bandwidth of $B/2$ which results in doubling the noise density $N_0=N/(B/2)=2N_0$ compared to a complex valued noise sequence with the same power.   

The energy of each BPSK symbol $E_b$ is the signal power $S$ divided by the symbol rate $R_b=1/T_b$.  The noise per unit bandwidth is the total noise power $N$ divided by the bandwidth $B$ of the system.  If we are simulating at one sample per symbol, $B=R_b$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{E_b}{N_0} &= \frac{S/R_b}{N/R_b} \\
                &= \frac{S}{N} \\
                &= \frac{A^2}{\sigma^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the amplitude of each BPSK symbol and $\sigma^2=N$ is the variance of the complex valued noise (mean noise energy per sample).  Given a set point $E_b/N_0$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:noise_sigma}
\sigma = \frac{A}{\sqrt{E_b/N_0}}
\end{equation}
The complex noise sample $r_i$ can be generated as:
\begin{equation}
r_i = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}}(\mathcal{N}_{2i}(0,1) + j\mathcal{N}_{2i+1}(0,1))
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}_i(0,1)$ is the $i-th$ sample of a unit variance, zero mean, real Gaussian noise source.  Note the noise power is split evenly between the real and imaginary arms. Our symbols passing through an AWGN channel can be simulated at complex baseband as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{z}_i &= z_i + r_i \\
\hat{q}_i &= q_i + r_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}
If the noise is zero mean, we can estimate $\sigma^2$ over $K$ noise samples $r_i$ as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = E[|r_i|^2] = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}|r_i|^2 
\end{equation}

\subsection{SNR Measurement}

In order to compare with other methods of speech communication that have varying bandwidths $B$, it is useful to formulate expressions for estimating SNR from the BPSK and QPSK symbols.  The Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:snr_theory}
\begin{split}
\frac{S}{N} &= \frac{E_bR_b}{N_0B} \\
            &= \frac{E_qR_q}{N_0B}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
A noise bandwidth $B$ needs to be selected; common choices are $B=R_b$, in which case $S/N=E_b/N_0$; for HF radio $B=3000$ Hz to compare with existing analog and digital voice waveforms; or $B=1$ to obtain a normalised $C/N_0$ carrier power to noise density ratio - useful for comparing waveforms with different bandwidths.
 
At one sample per symbol, the power, the mean energy of each QPSK symbol over a window of $K$ samples is given by:
\begin{equation}
E_q = E[|q_i|^2] = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}|q_i|^2
\end{equation}
Note the variance function should not be used to calculate $E_q$, as we cannot guarantee $q_i$ is zero mean. As each QPSK symbol contains 2 BPSK symbols, the energy is split evenly:
\begin{equation}
E_b = E_q/2
\end{equation}
For example if the symbol amplitude is $A=1, E_b=A^2=1$, then $E_q=1+1=2$.

To model transmission over multipath channels using OFDM we arrange the QPSK symbols as $N_c$ parallel carriers, each running at a symbol rate of $R_s=R_q/N_c$ symbols/s, where $R_s$ is chosen based on delay spread considerations.  Typical values for HF modems are $N_c=20$ and $R_s=50$ Hz. However the OFDM carriers are arranged such that the total symbol rate over the channel remains constant.  So for a given signal power $E_q$ and $E_b$ remain constant (Table \ref{tab:constant_eb}).

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l}
 \hline

 \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Calibration and Testing}

In order to evaluate the ML system early in the development process it is important to ensure the noise is correctly calibrated. The expressions above can be used to check the noise injection process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set a target $E_b/N_0$ for the simulation run, and calculate $\sigma$ using (\ref{eq:noise_sigma}).
\item Establish the equivalent target SNR from (\ref{eq:snr_theory}) evaluated using the target $E_b/N_0$.
\item After the simulation run measure $E_q=E[|q_i|^2]$ over a sample of transmitted symbols.  Note that in general $E_q \ne 2$ as the encoder outputs continuous values.
\item Calculate measured SNR using (\ref{eq:snr_theory}) and compare.
\end{enumerate}

The calibration of the noise injection can be checked by replacing the encoder output $z_i$ with discrete PSK symbols to create a digital modem, then measuring the BER at $E_b/N_0$ points. The theoretical BER over an AWGN channel is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ber_awgn}
BER = 0.5erfc(\sqrt{E_b/N_0})
\end{equation}
For a multipath channel:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ber_multipath}
BER = 0.5 \left(1-\sqrt{\frac{E_b/N_0}{E_b/N_0+1}} \right)
\end{equation}

\section{Comparison with Other Speech Waveforms}

We wish to compare our radio autoencoder with existing waveforms used for speech transmission over radio channels.  We start with the assumption that we have a transmitter of $C$ watts, and an AWGN channel with a spectral noise density of $N_0$ watts/Hz. As the speech waveforms being considered vary in bandwidth we will choose $C/N_0$ as the SNR metric.

The $C/N_0$ (in dBHz) at the demodulator input of a terrestrial radio receiver is given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{C}{N_0} = P - PAPR - L_{path} - NF + 174
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the maximum output power of the transmitter power amplifier, $PAPR$ is the Peak to Average Power Ratio of the waveform, $L_{path}$ is the path loss, $NF$ is the noise figure of the receiver.  For example consider a 400 MHz FM hand held radio over a 1km urban (non line of site) path.  The radio has a 1W (30 dBm) power output, $L_{path}=120$ dB, with noise dominated by ambient EMI such that $NF=10$ dB. $C/N_0 = 30 - 0 - 120 - 10 + 174 = 74$ dBHz, sufficient for good quality speech (Table \ref{tab:waveforms_good}).

Note that $C/N_0$ in the demodulator is a function of PAPR.  A high PAPR reduces the $C/N_0$ at the receiver.  We effectively ``back off" the transmitter power from the maximum $P$ by the PAPR.  We assume the PA is capable of sustaining $P$ watts indefinately. As PAPR varies by waveform, it should be included in any metric for comparison of waveforms.  We define $P/N_0$ as:
\begin{equation}
P/N_0 = C/N_0 + PAPR
\end{equation} 
A waveform that delivers intelligable speech at a low $P/N_0$ is the target.  A low PAPR waveform has other desirable properties, such as greater PA efficiency, longer battery life, and low cost semiconductors.

\section{Over the Cable and Over the Air Tests}

Impressive results have been obtained from the symbol rate simulations of an OFDM modem that assumed ideal synchronisation.  Need to verify using real radio signals.  This means building up a rate $Fs_s$ system, and synchronisation subsystems.  Choice was made to use classical DSP pilot symbol based syncronisation for the first pass, although we acknowldge potential for ML based syncrohinisation in future iterations.

Goal is to compare speech quality at $E_b/N_0=0dB$ (approx -3dB SNR in 3000 Hz), and work through any issues that prevent the system working over real radio channels.  A column of pilots between every $N_s=4$ pilots.  Ref freedv low study, this is 0.96dB loss in SNR and increase in bandwidth. TODO calculations.  Pilots used for coarse 

Pilot based sync built up in PyTorch, used for coarse and fine timing, phase and amplitide equalisation.  Unlike regular PSK, network is likely to be senstive to amplitude variations.  Phase qualisation allows small frequency offsets (+/- 2 Hz) to be tracked.

Several phase estimators were prototyped. They were tested using BER measurements. Issues with maintaining low loss syncronisation at low $E_b/N_0$.  Might be better to use lower dimension and higher $E_b/N_0$, which will allocate more power to pilots, less carriers.  Using per-carrier phase estimation makes the system less dependant on fine timing and the ability to handle multipath, but has higher loss.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{OFDM pilot based synchronisation algorithm performance, tested with digital PSK symbols on an AWGN channel. With ideal sync, intelligable speech is produced at $E_b/N_0=-6$ dB or BER=0.24.}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ofdm_sync} plots the perfomance of the OFDM pilot based synchronisation system used for the OTC/OTA tests on an AWGN channel.  The unsually low $E_b/N_0$ range we are considering is challenging.  The \emph{genie} curve is the baseline rate $F_s$ OFDM system with ideal sync, and matches the theoretical results.  Using this system, we can obtain intelligable speech at $E_b/N_0=-6$, or BER=0.24 in a digital system.  We can use the BER=0.25 line to estimate the loss of the synchronisation based system at this operating point, which for the \emph{mean6} and \emph{LS} algorithms under realistic conditions is around 2dB.

No CP inserted at this time.
TODO Figure of OFDM frame.  TODO Figure of OTC tests
TODO table/figure of sync results, discussion of issues

TODO further work, try lower dimension, higher Eb/No op point, put pilots in information sent to decoder, train with freq and phase offsets, train without pilots but phase/amp offsets, compare to classical DSP pilot losses.
